# LeetCode 875. Koko Eating Bananas
# Difficulty: Medium
# Topic: Binary Search
"""
Problem Understanding:
------------------
1. Given: piles of bananas and hours (h)
2. Need to find: minimum eating speed (k) to eat all bananas within h hours
3. Rules:
   - Can eat k bananas per hour from one pile
   - If pile has less than k bananas, eat all and wait
   - Must eat all bananas before h hours

Key Insight:
- This is a binary search on the answer (eating speed k)
- For any speed k, we can check if it's possible to eat all bananas in h hours
- The possible speeds form a monotonic pattern:
  * If speed k works, any speed > k works
  * If speed k doesn't work, any speed < k doesn't work

Detailed Solution Explanation:
---------------------------
1. Why Binary Search Works:
   - For any eating speed k:
     * If Koko can eat all bananas in â‰¤ h hours with speed k
     * She can definitely eat them with any speed > k
     * This creates a monotonic pattern perfect for binary search

2. Search Space:
   - Minimum speed = 1 (can't eat slower)
   - Maximum speed = max(piles) (no need to eat faster than largest pile)
   - Binary search in this range to find minimum valid speed

3. Checking Valid Speed:
   - For each pile, calculate hours needed with current speed
   - Use ceiling division (pile + speed - 1) // speed
   - Sum up total hours needed
   - Compare with target hours h

4. Optimizations:
   - Use ceiling division instead of math.ceil
   - Early return in can_eat_all if hours exceed h
   - Binary search on answer space instead of checking all speeds

5. Edge Cases Handled:
   - Single pile
   - h equal to number of piles
   - h greater than number of piles
   - Very large piles
