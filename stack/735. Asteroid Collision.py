LeetCode: 735. Asteroid Collision
Difficulty: Medium
Topic: Stack, Array, Simulation

Problem Description:
------------------
We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row. 
The indices of the asteroids in the array represent their relative position in space.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents 
its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves 
at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, 
the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. 
Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

Key Rules:
1. Positive asteroids move right (‚Üí)
2. Negative asteroids move left (‚Üê)
3. Collision only happens when right-moving asteroid is followed by left-moving asteroid
4. When they collide:
   - Smaller asteroid explodes
   - Same size: both explode
   - Larger asteroid survives

Example 1:
Input: asteroids = [5,10,-5]
Output: [5,10]
Explanation: The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.

Example 2:
Input: asteroids = [8,-8]
Output: []
Explanation: The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.

Example 3:
Input: asteroids = [10,2,-5]
Output: [10]
Explanation: The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5. The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.

Constraints:
* 2 <= asteroids.length <= 10^4
* -1000 <= asteroids[i] <= 1000
* asteroids[i] != 0

        Approach 1: Stack-based Simulation
        Use a stack to simulate the collision process.
        
        Algorithm:
        1. For each asteroid, check if it collides with the top of stack
        2. Collision happens when: current < 0 and stack[-1] > 0
        3. Handle collision based on sizes:
           - If stack asteroid is smaller: remove it and continue checking
           - If same size: remove both
           - If stack asteroid is larger: current asteroid explodes
        4. Add surviving asteroids to stack
